This is a Resourcepack called Colorcaecum. All it does is adding better textures for colorblind people to a few mods.
It also adds a new language called English (Colorblind Mode) which is recommended to use with this pack as it improves the quality of playing with the changed textures.
For further information, read this: https://github.com/Vexatos/Colorcaecum/blob/master/README.md

This pack is made for fun, and nothing else.
