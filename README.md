Colorcaecum
========

This is a Repository for a Resourcepack called Colorcaecum. All it does is adding better textures for colorblind people to a few mods. It also adds a new language called English (Colorblind Mode) which is recommended to use with this pack as it improves the quality of playing with the changed textures.

If you think some things in a mod need to get colorblindness-friendly texture, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Vexatos/Colorcaecum/issues).

Currently supported mods are:
  * RailCraft: Limiter Track, Locomotive Track, Signal Aspects (Aspect names have been changed in colorblind mode language)
  * Thermal Expansion: The machine I/O textures have been included in this pack

###Unity
This Resource Pack comes in two versions to download, the Vanilla and Unity Edition. While the Vanilla Edition is probably the one you should choose, the Unity Edition is supposed to provide support for [CyanideX' Unity 32x32 pack](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/texture-packs/222097-unity), so choose this version if you are using the Unity Resource Pack.

###Forecaster-Addon
The third file to download is an addon to either of the two Resource Pack versions, adding alternative textures for Railcraft Signals. If you like to have those textures a little different but still fine for colorblind people to use, try this.

This addon's textures are made by Forecaster. To use the addon, simply put it onto your Resource Pack stack, above the Colorcaecum pack. It does require one of the Colorcaecum versions to be present.

###Downloads
