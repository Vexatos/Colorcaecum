Colorcaecum
========

This is a Repository for a Resourcepack called Colorcaecum. All it does is adding better textures for colorblind people to a few mods.
If you think some things in a mod need to get colorblindness-friendly texture, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Vexatos/Colorcaecum/issues).

###Downloads

The downloads and change log for this pack can be found [here](https://github.com/Vexatos/Colorcaecum/releases).

This is entirely made for fun, and nothing else.
