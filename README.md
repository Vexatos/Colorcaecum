Colorcaecum
========

This is a Repository for a Resourcepack called Colorcaecum. All it does is adding better textures for colorblind people to a few mods. It also adds a new language called English (Colorblind Mode) which is recommended to use with this pack as it improves the quality of playing with the changed textures.

If you think some things in a mod need to get colorblindness-friendly texture, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Vexatos/Colorcaecum/issues).

Currently supported mods are:
  * RailCraft: Limiter Track, Locomotive Track, Signal Aspects (Aspect names have been changed in colorblind mode language)
  * Thermal Expansion: The machine I/O textures have been included in this pack
