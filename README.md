Colorcaecum
========

This is a Repository for a Resourcepack called Colorcaecum. All it does is adding better textures for colorblind people to a few mods. It also adds a new language called English (Colorblind Mode) which is recommended to use with this pack as it improves the quality of playing with the changed textures.

If you think some things in a mod need to get colorblindness-friendly texture, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Vexatos/Colorcaecum/issues).

Currently supported mods are:
  * RailCraft: Limiter Track, Locomotive Track, Signal Aspects (Aspect names have been changed in colorblind mode language)
  * Thermal Expansion: The machine I/O textures have been included in this pack

###Unity
This Resource Pack comes in two versions to download, the Vanilla and Unity Edition. While the Vanilla Edition is probably the one you should choose, the Unity Edition is supposed to provide support for [CyanideX' Unity 32x32 pack](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/texture-packs/222097-unity), so choose this version if you are using the Unity Resource Pack.

###Downloads

The downloads and change log for this pack can be found [here](https://github.com/Vexatos/Colorcaecum/releases).

###Other things

This pack is made for fun, and nothing else.
